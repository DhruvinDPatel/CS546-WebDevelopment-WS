                <b>Masters of Science in Computer Science(Aug 2016 - Dec 2017)<br></b>
                Note: I like something in every class, from the way of teaching, course structure/content etc. If I'd pick one then its CS573: Fundamental Of Cybersecurity.
                I liked the way of teaching of Prof. Edward Amoroso very much. And they made it very interesting. One of the memorable day was at mid of the semester, Prof explained
                Diffie-Hellman algorithm, which is very difficult to understand. Prof plot some simple shapes and they explained in a matter that any person who is not of security
                background also can understand that easily.

                <b>Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Engineering(2012-2016)<br></b>
                Note: This Bachelors course was combination of many Engineering concepts for first year and then it is consist of many Computer Science core subjects. My favourite 
                subject was Object Oriented Design and Implementation. I only knew about the functional and procedural programming approach till I came across that subject. I learned
                many OOD concepts like think every thing in terms of classes, function override, inheritance, polymorphism etc.
